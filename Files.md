# files.md

A brief description of the files

## dragino.toml

Contains the config information for TTN and the Dragino HAT. It supercedes the old dragino.ini and Frequncy.py files from the original code and provides a more complete Frequency Plan definition.

Much of the default TTN values are kept here but they are superceded by the contents of cache.json

## cache.json

This is used by the software to cache the TTN data. As it's name suggests it is a JSON formatted text file.

When the code first starts it is populated from the dragino.toml settings. MAC commands from the TTN server may modify the cached values.

After an OTAA join the keys are stored here so that it is no longer necessary to join every time the code is restarted.

If this file is deleted the dragino code will attempt to join TTN next time it runs

## showCache.py

Displays the contents of the cache.json file.

## test.py

A simple test which joins TTN and sends 5 messages.

## test_downlink.py

A simple test to check downlinks are received. Before running this you need to schedule a downlink message in the TTN console.

## testMAC.py

A simple test which sends a linkCheck MAC message with an uplink. The server should respond with a downlink with FOpts field containing gwcnt (gateway count) and margin (noise level above demodulation floor). Those values are put in the testMAC.log file.

The gwcnt indicates how many gateways picked up your transmission and is nice to know. The margin indicates how noisy the signal was but it is measured from the level required for reliable radio signal decoding by the radio hardware. Also nice to know. Read the LoRaWAN V1.0.x specification.

It is also possible the server sends a status request MAC command after joining. The dragino code will handle that and add it's reply to the list of replies to be sent. If that has happened it should appear in the testMAC.log file.

# dragino folder

##/_/_init/_/_.py

Used to create a new LoRaWAN message which is based on a Physical Payload and can be populated from a received message or populated for transmission.

## Config.py

Simply used to load the dragino.toml file into a dictionary which can be passed to other code which subsequently accesses it.

## GPShandler.py

GPS handling is done using GPSD to parse the GPS messages.

It uses threading to periodically sample the GPS TPV message. If a valid message is received it is cached with a timestamp.
This allows the Raspberry time to be synchronised with real world time.

Calls to get_gps() will return (lat, lon, timeStamp, lastGpsTimeReading)

The timestamp allows the caller to calculate the callers' actual time as follows :-

```
current_time=lastGpsTimeReading+(now()-timeStamp)
```

## MAChandler.py

On startup this module gets the default TTN parameters from dragino.toml which is read and passed in when dragino.py starts. If cache.json doesn't exist it is created with the default parameters.

If the end device receives MAC commands, from the server, which modify those parameters then the cache.json is updated by this module.

There are only two MAC uplink messages which can originate from the end device: linkCheckReq and timeReq. All others come from the server and require an acknowledgment in the next uplink.

Assuming you have instantiated Dragino like this:
```
from dragino import Dragino
D=Dragino(...)
```
the MAC commands can be added to the next uplink with:-
```
D.MAC.link_check_req()
D.MAC.time_req()
```

The time_req is not very useful since the returned value does not compensate for network latency.

The LoRaWAN V1.0.x specification states that multiple MAC commands may occur in a message occupying up to 16 bytes in total. The MAC handler places commands and replies into a list. When dragino.py requests the list with D.MAC.getFOpts() the list is cleared so that it isn't sent with all uplink messages.

## reset.py

A legacy program which resets the radio hardware.

## Strings.py

Used by other modules to ensure variable name capitalisation is uniform.

# dragino/LoraWan

For the most part the files in this folder are the standard file from computenodes. They tend to lack useful comments. The following have been modified :-

## FHDR.py

Modified to accept an FOpts parameter when the create() method is called like this:-
```
lorawan.create(MHDR.UNCONF_DATA_UP, {
            'devaddr': devaddr,
            'fcnt': FCntUp,
            'data': message,
            'fport=':1,
            'fopts':FOpts})

```
## MACpayload.py

Modified to allow the LoRaWAN port number to be changed from the default of 1. See FHDR.py example above.

# dragino/SX127x
